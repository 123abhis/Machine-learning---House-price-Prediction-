House Price Prediction using Machine Learning
Project Overview

This project is a Machine Learning-based web application that predicts house prices based on features such as area (sq. ft), number of bedrooms, and other attributes.
It helps users estimate property prices using a trained regression model, offering insights into real estate pricing trends.

*) Key Features
 1) Predict house prices based on input features
 2) Preprocessed and cleaned dataset for training
 3) Trained machine learning model (Linear Regression / Random Forest)
 4) Flask web interface for user interaction
 5) Visual analysis using scatter plots and correlations
